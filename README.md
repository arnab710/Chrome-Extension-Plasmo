# Plasmo AI-Powered Extension Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to our comprehensive guide for developing a **Chrome extension** using the **Plasmo framework**, a renowned toolset streamlined for extension development. Our primary objective is to leverage an advanced **AI model** to provide **real-time, user-friendly responses** in a **streamed** format.

This extension is designed to interact seamlessly with our custom-built **backend API**, developed using **Next.js 13/14**. The backend plays a pivotal role in processing and streaming AI-generated responses based on user interactions. For an in-depth understanding of our backend architecture and functionalities, you can visit our dedicated repository: [Next.js AI Backend](https://github.com/arnab710/Next.js-AI-Backend).

In this documentation, we will walk you through the key components and functionalities of our Plasmo extension, providing **step-by-step instructions** and insights into our development process.
