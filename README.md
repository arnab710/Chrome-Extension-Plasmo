# Plasmo AI-Powered Extension Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to our comprehensive guide for developing a Chrome extension using the Plasmo framework, a renowned toolset streamlined for extension development. Our primary objective is to leverage an advanced AI model to provide real-time, user-friendly responses in a streamed format.

This extension is designed to interact seamlessly with our custom-built backend API, developed using Next.js. The backend plays a pivotal role in processing and streaming AI-generated responses based on user interactions. For an in-depth understanding of our backend architecture and functionalities, you can visit our dedicated repository: [Next.js AI Backend](https://github.com/arnab710/Next.js-AI-Backend).

In this documentation, we will walk you through the key components and functionalities of our Plasmo extension, providing step-by-step instructions and insights into our development process.
